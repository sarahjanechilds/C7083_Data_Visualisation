The most important method by which to communicate data is through graphical displays.
This module has set the assignment to do so in the form of a visual essay and a short critique of two graphical displays.  
The title is "From Milk to Mozzarella: the Changing face of American Dairy". It discusses the data from the USDA on milk sales, state production, and dairy product range and consumption.
The data for the visual essay has been sourced from Github's Tidy Tuesday, 2019-01-29 found at https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-01-29.  
On this repo you will find the r script, quarto qmd, pdf and html docs.
