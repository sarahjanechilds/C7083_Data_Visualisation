### html link: 
The most important method by which to communicate data is through graphical displays. This module has set the assignment to do so in the form of a visual essay and a short critique of two graphical displays already out in public use. The data for the visual essay has been sourced from Github's Tidy Tuesday, 2019-01-29 found at https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-01-29.  
On this repo you will find the r script, quarto doc, pdf and html docs.
